# Agile Editor


## The Purpose of This Project:

Quickly accessing and editing important documents is very important for highly collaborative teams. 
As users start to need more and more browser tabs, even powerful computers quickly slow down. 
There is a real opportunity to reduce the clicks and time needed to access, edit and share documents when compared to today’s web-based alternatives (ie Google Docs). 



## Some Key Features:

• Built contentEditable based collaborative rich text editor with Draft.js.

• Architected modular single-page application using React, React Router, and Redux.

• Implemented real time collaborative feature with shared cursor highlighting using WebSockets.

• Built a desktop based application by implementing Electron.

## Main Technologies Utilized:

React.js; Socket.io; Draft.js; Node.js; Express; MongoDB; Electron.js;
